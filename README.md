In this project, there are totally three forms to consist of the minesweeper application: 
1. The main form contains: 2 textboxs that are used to diplay the player name and the number of currently opened games; 4 radio buttons 
for labels Easy, Medium, Expert, and Custom (by default, Medium is checked); 2 buttons to start a new game and close all opened games;
A menustrip with items “Play a new game”, “Close all games”, “Exit”. The first item has a sub- menu containing “Easy”, “Medium”, and “Expert”. 
2. The second form is used for showing a dialog when the “Custom” ratio button is checked. The dialog will ask user to input # of rows, # of 
columns, and # of mines in the game board. 
3. The third form is used to display the game board that made of row*col buttons. There are two textboxs that showing the clock and another 
showing the number of mines minus the number of flags. The game (and clock) starts when the player makes the first left-click” on one of the 
buttons on the board. At this moment, the mines get uniformly, but randomly distributed over the board in a way that no mines are placed on 
the first-click square and its surrounding squares. A right-click on a covered cell will place a flag on that cell.
